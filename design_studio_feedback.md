It was suggested to me that I highlight the conference that a team plays in when the team is selected (or hovered over).
  * I like this idea and hope to implement it in a different way by showing more team details in some place in the visualization, I will have to edit my designs to implement this.

There is no indication as to what the numbers on the graph axes are describing.
  * I need to add axis titles (as well as titles for each of the views)

When selecting a team, it would be nice if gridlines could appear so that the user can quickly locate the cross section for a week/rank.
  * This is a good idea, and I'm not sure if I will implement in this way, but I do need to have some way for the user to know the team's ranking for a given week.

Unsure what the relationship between the two views (heatmap and poll graph).
  * This is something that I have yet to implement but I do have it planned.

What is the purpose of this visualization?
  * I see this more as an alternative exploratory tool for the college basketball data, rather than attempting to derive something statistically significant.

David suggested maybe using a treemap instead of the colored calendar, so that when you click on a day, it expands to show the number of games per conference.
  * I'm unsure if this would work, but I am willing to spend an hour or two investigating its feasability.

Add some visual cue to highlight the interactivity in the heatmap calendar.
  * Another thing that I will eventually implement in some form, probably using hover events. Though I'm not sure if the js plugin I am attempting to use now will allow for that. It may require me to go back and make the original implementation work.

Color scale is not easily discernible, goes from green to dark red, largest to smallest amount. Also, not a great use of color for those with red-green blindness.
  * The color scale shown during the design studio was the default used by Mike Bostock in the example this viz was copied from.

When using the slider, you could highlight the week in the graph and make everything around it more transparent to make it stand out.
  * This was on my list of things I would like to try and accomplish, I'm not sure of how easy it might be to select certain portions of the paths to make transparent, but will investigate.

Add color and scales to the conference bar chart
  * Another thing that was planned but not yet implemented.


There was a lot of fair and helpful advice offered by David and Glen. All in all, we had a great conversation about our respective projects and I think they will both be better for it.
